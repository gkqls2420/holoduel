# HoloDuel Client
This is the client repo for HoloDuel.
This is a fan implementation of the Hololive card game.
I have no affiliation with Cover/Hololive. I own none of the assets/IP.

# Setup
Install Godot 4.3.
Clone the repo.
Run the server locally or change UseAzureServerAlways to true to hit the Azure server.

In debug builds, the app defaults to localhost for the server.
In release builds, the app hits the Azure server.
